# Syntactic-analysis-using-Rnn-
This project implements a syntactic analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to perform syntactic structure recognition on sentences. The goal is to analyze sentence patterns and predict syntactic roles such as subjects, verbs, objects, and phrases based on sequence modeling.
